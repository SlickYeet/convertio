# Markdown to PDF Converter

An app that started because I needed a markdown to PDF converter. I thought to
myself, "How hard can it be to make my own?" Well, here we are, with a simple
tool that converts your markdown files into polished PDF documents.

## Is there more planned?

Yes, infact now that the initial functionality is completed I am planning on
adding more conversion options, making this app into a fully featured converter.

## Features

- Converts Markdown files to PDF with ease
- Supports basic Markdown syntax (headings, lists, code blocks, etc.)
- Simple user interface

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the converter with your Markdown file as input.

## Usage

```sh
# run the dev server
pnpm dev

# build the app
pnpm build

# check for linting errors
pnpm lint

# format the the code
pnpm format

# perform a clean install of the dependencies
pnpm clean
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to
improve the converter.
